Deaf person in Malaysia only around 66,000 out of 30 million people in Malaysia making there are minority people in their own country. They are looking like normal people but they are lacking their sense of hearing organ. This might be the problem for them because they canâ€°Ã›Âªt to use the public facility like us, normal person. Not that all, family problem also the cause for deaf people. In normal family, possibility to get deaf child is possible. So parents will try to ask the child to use hearing aids or put implant to the child. This can increase the cost because the hearing aids is costly RM2000 to RM 18,000 and the implant costly around RM50,000 with government subsidies and RM150,000 without subsidies. The problem is, are the deaf have enough money to do the implant? This is the big problem for them. This is also the cause deaf person feels marginalized from normal person. They canâ€°Ã›Âªt speak or communicate to normal person normally and feeling isolated when they try to say something to normal person.
